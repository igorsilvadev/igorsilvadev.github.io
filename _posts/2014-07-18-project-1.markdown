description: Welcome to the world of Darko, an infinite running game that will challenge your reflexes!
Travel through a forest full of endless secrets, spirits and enemies. Help the spirit of light survive the darkness on its way!

Darko seeks to innovate gameplay from the player's interaction with the screen, creating a new experience within infinite racing games. Enemies attack unpredictably and quickly, multiplying as the stages progress. In addition, the player must have agile fingers to prevent enemies from touching our hero. Be careful not to miss the limited rewards that appear on the map!
