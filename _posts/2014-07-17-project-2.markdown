description: Welcome to iBete!
This application is intended to help you manage your glucose levels. With it, you can write down your glucose levels as many times as needed during the day and keep everything in one place.
You can also schedule personalized notifications to remind you when it is time to measure your glucose again.
The data you add also generates graphs where you can analyze all the records over time in a visual way.
